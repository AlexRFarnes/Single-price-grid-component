## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project to practice my layout skills, specifically the use of CSS Grid. CSS Grid is such an awesome tool but I have had some trouble getting the hang of it. I also wanted to practice with the use of CSS custom properties because I haven't had much practice with them. I found out that they help a lot to speed up the process when changes are needed because I just had to change them in one place instead of all the places where I used that property.

### Continued development

I want to keep practicing with layouts and CSS Grid properties. Also, learn more about the BEM methodology.
